answer = "Apply a coat the same thickness as the magnets and make sure it's 80% dried before magnetizing lashes for the best hold!

answer = "The Magnetic Eyeliner ingredients are all commonly found in makeup and skincare products & are cruelty free. The added ingredient that makes the eyeliner work is iron oxide. See below for the breakdown and the safety level of all ingredients as cited in EWG's Skin Deep Cosmetic Database. However, for the health and safety of our customers, we do not recommend any eye products to anyone with pre-existing eye conditions.\n\n\\*We strongly suggest that you try our products on a small patch of skin (other than the intended location), to test for any allergic reactions first. We also urge everyone to review our product ingredients first to avoid sensitivities."
question = "What is in the Magnetic Liner & is it safe/cruelty free?"
[[faq]]
answer = "Yes, all our products have been tested for safety. Our eyeliner has the same types of ingredients you might see in other liners or mascara. Now what makes our liner magnetic is our iron oxide ingredient. There are no heavy metals or parabens in our formula. Iron oxide is a cosmetic ingredient commonly used for pigment and is rated as non-toxic according to EWG’s skin deep profile. Of course, as with any eye cosmetic products, if you have any pre-existing eye conditions, consult your doctor."
question = "The Magnetic Liner Ingredients/Is it safe?"
[[faq]]
answer = "With proper care, the magnetic eyelashes can last up to 30+ times. You want to clean the magnets on the lash after every use and place them back into the magnetic lash tray to magnetize the magnets. This keeps them clean and helps the magnets last longer! Please avoid any water contact with the lashes as they will lose their curl and shape. The lifespan of the eyeliner is 6 months after opening."

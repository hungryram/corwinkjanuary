Our Magnetic Liner will hold your favorite CorWink Lash _all day_! Its brush tip allows for an easy application. Our formula dries **matte black** and the best part is the that it is **smudge-proof** & **waterproof**! Once you go Magnetic, you'll never forget it!

**How To Use:**

1. Shake Magnetic Liner for about 30 seconds.
2. Apply a thick line with the Magnetic Liner
   * As thick as the magnets.
3. For optimal results, apply another layer or two.
4. Let it dry for about 1 minute.

**How To Remove:**

1. Use an oil-based cleanser, olive oil, or coconut oil.
   * Olive oil works best!
2. Use your choice of remover to _roll_ the Magnetic Liner off your lash-line & lashes with a q-tip.

**Caution:** Please perform a patch test before use in case of allergies. If contact in eyes, wash eyes thoroughly with water. If allergens persist, seek medical attention. Please keep out of reach of children. If you have pre-existing eye conditions, consult with a physician before using. Only use as directed.
